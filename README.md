Welcome to my **10-day AWS Hands-on Learning Journey**, where I documented my progress as a developer exploring **cloud deployment, networking, serverless, databases, and CI/CD** - all under AWS Free Tier.
This repository is structured **day-wise**, showing how I learned and implemented AWS services step-by-step with screenshots and explanations.
