# ☁️ AWS Cloud Learning Journey — MERN Developer Edition

Welcome to my **10-day AWS Hands-on Learning Journey**, where I documented my progress as a developer exploring **cloud deployment, networking, serverless, databases, and CI/CD** — all under AWS Free Tier.

This repository is structured **day-wise**, showing how I learned and implemented AWS services step-by-step with screenshots and explanations.

## 🧭 Learning Objective

> “To understand AWS from a developer’s perspective — how each service fits into the lifecycle of a real-world MERN application.”

By the end of this series, I learned to:
- Configure IAM securely for programmatic access  
- Host static and full-stack apps on AWS  
- Manage networking with VPC and Security Groups  
- Deploy scalable Node/Express APIs on EC2  
- Integrate with RDS and DynamoDB for persistence  
- Build serverless functions with AWS Lambda  
- Automate deployments via GitHub Actions  
- Monitor app health with CloudWatch  
- Configure custom domains with Route 53

## 🧠 Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|--------|-------------|
| Frontend | React (Vite) |
| Backend | Node.js + Express |
| Database | MongoDB Atlas / RDS (MySQL/PostgreSQL) / DynamoDB |
| Deployment | AWS EC2, S3, CloudFront, Lambda |
| DevOps | GitHub Actions, PM2, Nginx |
| Monitoring | CloudWatch, Billing Alerts |
| Networking | VPC, Subnets, Route Tables, IAM |

## 📸 Highlights

Throughout the repo, you’ll find annotated screenshots (`.png`) and `notes.md` files in each day’s folder that explain:
- What each AWS service does  
- How I set it up  
- Commands I used  
- How everything connects in a real app  

---

## 🧩 Repository Purpose

This repo is not just about hosting apps — it’s about **understanding AWS as a full-stack developer**.

Each day builds logically on the previous:
- Days 1–4 → Foundations (IAM → S3 → EC2)
- Days 5–7 → Core AWS Services (RDS → Lambda → IAM Roles)
- Days 8–10 → Professional Edge (CI/CD → Monitoring → Domains)

---

## 🚀 Final Goal

By **Day 10**, the goal is to have a **complete AWS-based portfolio**:
- One static website hosted via S3 + CloudFront  
- One full-stack MERN app running on EC2  
- Database connected via RDS/DynamoDB  
- Automated CI/CD setup  
- Serverless API endpoint (Lambda)  
- Domain + SSL via Route 53
